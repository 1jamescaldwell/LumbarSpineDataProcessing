# MatlabDataProcessing
A collection of scripts that import data and generate plots for UVA's Center for Applied Biomechanics Lab RCCADS Lumbar project. RCCADS (Research Consortium for Crashworthiness in Automated Driving Systems) sponsored a project studying lower back (aka Lumbar Spine) injuries for reclined seating positions in a car crash.

Code:
1. RCCADS_Lumbar_Data_Import - imports all test data from UVA's Center for Applied Biomechanics test series into a struct called RCCADS_Lumbar.
2. RCCADS_Lumbar_Plotting - calls various plotting functions to generate translation, rotation, force, moment, pressure transducer, and other plots for each test run.
